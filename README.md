# NottDex.com FrontEnd
This is not a representative repository for my abilities, I am not a front-end engineer nor have I taken any courses to become one. A lot of this code comes with the help of AI and inspect element.

If you want to see a repository that more accurately represents my coding abilities, check out the [backend here](https://github.com/deepnimma/NottAnotherMasterSetTrackerBackend)

Feel free to open up issues for bug requests, features or missing cards!

Also feel free to contact me on discord `@nottcurious` to discuss anything about the website.
